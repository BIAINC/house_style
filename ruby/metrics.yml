    If lines are too short, methods become hard to read because you must
    constantly jump from line to line. If lines are too long, following
    the flow can be hard because it becomes harder to scan back and
    locate the start of the next line. 80 characters is generally a bit
    too short; 120 characters is a good compromise.
